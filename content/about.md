Hi, welcome to my blog!

I'm Harpreet Singh, a software engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand. This is my blog where I write about anything new I learned or found interesting. I also use this as a way to document my learnings for myself. This blog will mostly contain posts about software engineer although I might occasionally add posts on other subjects as well that I find interesting.

You should be able to see all my contact links in the header on this website, feel free to send me an email or discussion or comments about anything. I've also used [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es) to add commenting functionality to my blogs.
