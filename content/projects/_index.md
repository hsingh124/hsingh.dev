### Note-It-Down
This is the project I am currently working on. It's basically a chrome extension that lets you easily take notes on a particular scroll location on a web page and save it. It's got a lot of work to be done on it. Some future ideas I have for this are making it like a text based browser assistant. So you can type commands and execute. It's in the really early stages of development right now, but the next features I want to add in this are the ability to save and categorise notes with tags.\
