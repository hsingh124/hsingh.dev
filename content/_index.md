### Hey, I'm Harpreet Singh
I am a software engineer working in Auckland, New Zealand. This is my website where I write blogs about tech, share updates about my projects or really post anything I think is interesting. Some of the subjects I am interested in are computer networking, computer architecture and software architecture. I also do want to learn about machine learning.

### What I'm doing now
Currently, I am working as a full stack engineer where I mostly code in PHP for the backend and TypeScript for the frontend. I am also working on a personal project which is a chrome extension for easy note taking on the web: [note-it-down](https://github.com/hsingh124/note-it-down). The code is not as clean yet but I am working on it ðŸ˜…. Apart from that I am also learning more about computer architecture, just for fun.

### Tools
Currently I use [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my main code editor with the [One Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme).
For note taking I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
About this site, this was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
