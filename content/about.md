Hi, welcome to my blog!

I'm Harpreet Singh, a software engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand. This is my blog where I write about anything new I learned or found interesting. I also use this as a way to document my learnings for myself. This blog will mostly contain posts about software engineering although I might occasionally add posts on other subjects as well that I find interesting.

You'll find all my contact links in the website header. Feel free to reach out and connect!. I've also used [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es) to add commenting functionality to my blogs.
